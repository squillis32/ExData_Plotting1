Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 1
===================================================================================
This repository is for the Coursera "Exploratory Data Analysis" course project #1.

The goal is to simply examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.

The data for this project can be downloaded through the following link:

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

=========================================================================================

You should create four R scripts called plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R that does the following.

1- Construct the plot and save it ot a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

2- Name each of the plot files as plt1.png, plot2.png, etc.

3- Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e.
   code in plot1. R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data
   so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.

Files
Codebook.md describes the varibles, the data, and any work performed to clean up the data.
plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R contains the R scripts that performs the analysis on the raw data.
plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png are the end results from running the conde on the four R scripts.
